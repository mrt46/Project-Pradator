================================================
## AGENT SPECIFICATION – UI / DASHBOARD AGENT
## PROJECT PREDATOR
================================================

Agent Name:
UI / Dashboard Agent

Agent Class:
Non-Learning / Visualization & Observability Agent (READ-ONLY)

Phase Applicability:
- FORBIDDEN before PHASE 4
- LIMITED (internal observability only) in PHASE 4–5
- FULL UI exposure only after PHASE 6 (Stability Gate)

================================================
## 1. MISSION STATEMENT
================================================

Primary Mission:
Expose the INTERNAL STATE of the system to humans
in a clear, truthful, and non-deceptive manner.

UI Agent answers:
→ “What is the system doing right now?”
→ “What happened historically?”

UI Agent does NOT answer:
→ “What should we do?”
→ “Is this safe to trade live?”

================================================
## 2. CORE RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================

UI / Dashboard Agent IS responsible for:

- Displaying system state (INIT / IDLE / RUNNING / HALTED)
- Displaying active agents and their status
- Visualizing portfolio-level summaries
- Showing strategy activity (IDs, not logic)
- Displaying risk & compliance status flags
- Rendering logs and alerts in human-readable form
- Providing historical views of system behavior

UI Agent is NOT responsible for:
- Making decisions
- Triggering actions
- Editing configurations
- Deploying code
- Interacting with exchanges

================================================
## 3. INPUTS (WHAT UI AGENT CAN SEE)
================================================

UI Agent MAY access:

- System state snapshots
- Agent health/status metrics
- Aggregated performance metrics (from KPI Agent)
- Risk status flags (from CRO)
- Compliance status flags
- Execution summaries (high-level)
- Logs and alerts (filtered)

UI Agent MAY NOT access:

- Raw strategy logic
- Indicator internals
- Private keys or secrets
- Order-level execution details (unless approved)
- Learning internals
- Configuration write access

================================================
## 4. OUTPUTS (WHAT UI AGENT CAN PRODUCE)
================================================

UI Agent outputs ONLY:

- Visual dashboards
- Read-only status panels
- Historical charts
- Alert notifications (display only)

UI Agent NEVER outputs:
- Commands
- Approvals
- Configuration changes
- Trade triggers

================================================
## 5. UI GOVERNANCE RULES
================================================

UI Agent MUST:

- Reflect reality accurately
- Avoid misleading smoothing or aggregation
- Clearly label data freshness
- Indicate DEGRADED or HALTED states visibly
- Never hide errors or alerts

UI Agent MUST NOT:
- Beautify data at the expense of truth
- Mask drawdowns
- Imply recommendations
- Provide false confidence

================================================
## 6. LEARNING SCOPE
================================================

UI Agent is a STRICT NON-LEARNING agent.

It does NOT:
- Adapt visuals based on user behavior
- Learn which metrics to emphasize
- Optimize layouts for persuasion

Reason:
UI must inform, not influence.

================================================
## 7. INTERACTION WITH OTHER AGENTS
================================================

UI Agent interactions:

- Subscribes to read-only data streams
- Receives metrics from KPI Analyst
- Receives risk/compliance flags
- Displays Sentinel alerts
- Notifies humans of system state changes

UI Agent CANNOT:
- Send instructions to any agent
- Override CRO or Compliance
- Trigger execution or deployment

================================================
## 8. FAILURE MODES & SAFETY
================================================

Known Failure Risks:
- Stale data display
- Partial state visibility
- UI lag during load

Guards:
- Data freshness indicators
- Explicit “unknown” states
- Backpressure handling
- Clear error banners

================================================
## 9. KILL CONDITIONS (WHEN UI AGENT IS DISABLED)
================================================

UI Agent is DISABLED if:

- System enters SHUTDOWN
- Compliance freezes external visibility
- Human disables UI access

Disabling UI Agent:
- Does NOT affect trading
- Reduces observability only

================================================
## 10. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
================================================

UI Agent:
- Cannot trade
- Cannot decide
- Cannot learn
- Cannot configure
- Cannot hide system state

================================================
## 11. SUMMARY (ONE SENTENCE)
================================================

UI / Dashboard Agent is the system’s window:
clear glass reveals strength and cracks alike.
